LogikSim
========

### Our Vision ###

Our vision is to build the earth's best software to understand digital 
circuits; A logic simulator that makes it easy and fun to explore and 
design digital circuits starting from simple AND gates, up to complex 
computing systems as we see them today.

### Who uses LogikSim ###

Our target audience are newcomers to the field of digital electronics 
of any age. We specifically target educational programs. For which 
we provide a free solution to gain practical experience in upper 
high school or university level courses. With our software students 
can design logic circuits by themselves and learn key lessons 
from firsthand experience. We are sure this will both increase the 
depth and quality of courses covering digital circuits. 

### Why we build LogikSim ###

We have always been fascinated by the huge levels of abstraction that 
makes it possible to build processors from simple two input logic 
functions like the AND. With LogikSim we want to share this fascination. 
With LogikSim it is possible to learn one abstraction layer after the 
other. The starting point are simple digital element. You will 
quickly transition to more complex functions like adders. The next 
step will be to introduce feedbacks and build circuits that can store 
information. This will enable you to build flip-flops, opening the 
door to sequential logic. By introducing clocks you can build state 
machines and more complex memories. Your final task will be to abstract 
from the logic layer. First you will think about how to build programmable
state machines that operate on programs stored in memories.
This will lead the path to a formalized instruction set and memory 
sub-systems. This final step will bridge the gap to software programming
and make you grasp how today processors operate.
