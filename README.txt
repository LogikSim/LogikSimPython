LogikSim
========

Our vision is to build the earth's best software to understand digital 
circuits; A logic simulator that makes it easy and fun to explore and 
design digital circuits starting from simple AND gates, up to complex 
computing systems as we see them today.

The target audience of LogikSim are newcomers to the field of digital 
electronics of any age. We specifically target educational programs. 
For which we provide a free solution to gain practical experience in 
upper high school or university level courses. With our software 
students can design logic circuits by themselves and learn key lessons 
from firsthand experience. We are sure this will both increase the 
depth and quality of courses covering digital circuits. 

We have always been fascinated by the huge levels of abstraction that 
makes it possible to build processors from simple two input logic 
functions like the AND. With LogikSim we want to share this fascination. 
With LogikSim it is possible to learn one abstraction layer after the 
other. The starting point are simple digital element. But you will 
quickly transition to more complex functions like adders. The next 
step will be to introduce feedbacks and build circuits that can store 
information. This will enable you to build flip-flops and opening the 
door to sequential logic. By introducing clocks you can build state 
machines, memories and already start to think about writing programs 
for these machines. Your final task will be to abstract from the 
logic layer and by introducing an instruction set architecture. 
This will set the stage for processors and memory sub-systems 
that will finally make you grasp how today processors operate.

The project is currently under heavy development, see src for 
more information on how you can help us.
